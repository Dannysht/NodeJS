<h2>Client-side redirection vs. server-side redirection.</h2>
<p>Client-side redirection, also known as client-side forwarding or JavaScript redirection, is a type of redirection that occurs within the user's web browser.<br>
    This is typically achieved by using JavaScript to modify the browser's current location or by using the HTML meta tag to redirect the browser to a new URL. <br>
    Client-side redirection is fast and responsive, as the redirection occurs immediately within the user's browser. <br>
    However, it is also less reliable, as it depends on the user's browser and JavaScript settings.
</p>
<p>
    Server-side redirection, on the other hand, is a type of redirection that occurs on the server-side of a web application. <br>
    This is typically achieved by using server-side code, to redirect the user's browser to a new URL. <br>
    Server-side redirection is more reliable, as it does not depend on the user's browser or JavaScript settings.<br>
    However, it can also be slower and less responsive, as the user's browser must wait for the server to respond with the new URL.

<h2>Fetching in the client vs. fetching in the frontend</h2>
<p>
    Fetching data in the client typically refers to the process of making HTTP requests to a server from within the client-side code of a web application, <br>
    such as JavaScript running in a user's web browser. <br>
    This allows the client-side code to dynamically load and update data from a server without requiring a full page refresh.
</p>
<p>
    Fetching data in the frontend, on the other hand, refers to the process of retrieving data from a backend API <br>
    or server using server-side code.<br>
    The data is typically retrieved in response to a client-side request, <br>
    such as an AJAX request made using JavaScript.

<h2>Structuring HTML with semantic HTML</h2>
<p>
    Structuring HTML with semantic HTML involves using HTML tags that convey meaning and describe the content of the page. <br>
    Semantic HTML helps search engines and other web crawlers understand the structure and content of the page, <br>
    making it easier to index and rank the page in search results.
    Examples of semantic HTML tags include header, nav, main, footer, etc. <br>
    These tags provide additional context and meaning to the content on the page, making it easier for both humans and machines to understand.
