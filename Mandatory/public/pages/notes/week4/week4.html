<h2>Fetch</h2>
<p>
    In JavaScript, "fetch" is a method that allows you to make network requests to a server and retrieve data from it. It is commonly used to retrieve data from an API (Application Programming Interface). The fetch method returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object, which represents the response to the request made to the server. You can use the Response object to extract data from the response, such as headers and body, and use it in your application. The fetch method can be used to make requests with different HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and you can also pass in options such as headers and request body.
