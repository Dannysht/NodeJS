<h1>Week 2</h1>
<h2>Linters</h2>
<p>
A linter is a tool that checks code for potential errors and violations of coding conventions. <br>
Linters can help enforce clean code conventions by flagging issues such as syntax errors, unused variables, and inconsistent formatting. <br>They can also provide suggestions for improving code readability and maintainability. Some popular linters include ESLint for JavaScript, Pylint for Python, and RuboCop for Ruby.

<h2>Callback functions</h2>
<p>
    A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is called by that function when a specific event or condition occurs. <br>The callback function can be executed at different times depending on the context, and it can have access to the variables and parameters of the parent function.

<h2>Package.json</h2>
<p>
    The package.json file is a metadata file used in Node.js projects to manage dependencies, scripts, and other project information. <br>It is located in the root directory of a Node.js project and is usually created when a new project is initialized using the npm init command.

<br>The package.json file contains information about the project such as its name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies. <br>The dependencies section lists all the packages that the project depends on, along with their version numbers. <br>This allows other developers to easily install all the required packages for the project by simply running the npm install command.<br>
The package.json file is an important part of the Node.js ecosystem and is used by many tools and services to manage and deploy Node.js projects. <br>It is also used by package managers such as npm and yarn to install and manage dependencies for a project.
</p>
<h2>Express</h2>
<p>Express.js is a popular open-source web framework for Node.js that provides a simple and flexible way to build web applications and APIs. It provides a set of features and tools that help <br>developers create robust and scalable web applications quickly and easily.</p>
