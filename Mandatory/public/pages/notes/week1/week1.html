<h2>
    Intro to Node.js
</h2>
<p>
    With Node.js, developers can use JavaScript on the server-side, <br>which was previously limited to client-side programming in web browsers. <br>
    Node.js provides a rich set of built-in modules and libraries that allow developers to handle various tasks <br>such as file system access, networking, and database interactions.<br> It also has a vast ecosystem of third-party modules and tools available through the npm package manager, 
    <br>which can help streamline development and enhance the functionality of applications.
</p>
<h2>
    Variables and Data types
</h2>
<h3>
    Data types
</h3>
<p>
    Number: represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
</p>
<p>
    String: represents a sequence of characters.
</p>
<p>
    Boolean: represents a logical entity and can have one of two values: true or false.
</p>
<p>
    Null: represents a deliberate non-value or non-existent value.
</p>
<p>
    Undefined: represents an uninitialized value or a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
</p>
<p>
    Object: represents a collection of properties and can include other data types, functions, and more.
</p>
<p>
    Symbol: represents a unique identifier.
</p>
<h3>
Variables
</h3> 
<p>Variables in JavaScript are containers that hold data values.</p>
<p>To declare a variable in JavaScript, you can use the var, let, or const keyword
</p>
<p>
    var: declares a variable globally, or locally to a function, regardless of block scope.
</p>
<p>
    let: declares a block-scoped variable, which means it only exists within the block it was declared in.
</p>
<p>
    const: declares a block-scoped variable that cannot be reassigned a new value once it has been initialized.
</p>

<h2>
    REST API Conventions
</h2>
<p>
    1. Use of HTTP methods: RESTful APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) to perform operations on resources.
</p>
<p>
    2. Resource-based URLs: Each resource should have a unique URL that identifies it, and the URL should only represent the resource, not the action being performed on it.
</p>
<p>
    3. Use of HTTP status codes: HTTP status codes should be used to indicate the success or failure of an API call.
</p>

<p>
    4. Consistent naming conventions: Resources, URLs, and other elements of the API should follow consistent naming conventions to make them easily understandable and predictable.

<h2>
    Clean code conventions
</h2>
<p>
    Clean code conventions refer to a set of best practices and guidelines for writing code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. <br>
    These conventions focus on improving the quality of code by making it more modular, efficient, and easier to test. 
    <br>
    Some common clean code conventions include using meaningful variable and function names, <br>keeping functions and classes small and focused, writing comments and documentation, and following consistent coding style.
